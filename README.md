# Video Conferencing React / [Demo](https://video-conferencing-react.web.app/)

This is a project to be able to do video conferences implementing WebRTC technology alongside libraries from [Muaz Khan's projects](https://github.com/muaz-khan/WebRTC-Experiment).
This project uses a peer-to-peer mesh network to connect with everyone in the room.
This project uses [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) as a base for the frontend.
